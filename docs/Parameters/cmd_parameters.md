# Ð¡ommand-line parameters

	
**POST-INSTALL EXAMPLE DATA**

- `--sampledata`  
Creates the *uorf4u_data* folder in the current working directory.
The folder will contain an adjustable configuration file template, SD-aSD energies table and helper scripts.


**MANDATORY ARGUMENTS**

- `-an` *accession_number*  
Protein's RefSeq accession number.

	OR

- `-hl` *accession_number1 [accession_number2, ...]*  
Space separated list of proteins accession numbers which will be used as list of homologous.

	OR

- `-hlf` *file.txt*
Path to a file with list of accession numbers. File format: one accession number per line, no header.


**OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS**

- `-al` *path_to/assemblies_list.tsv*  
Path to an assemblies list file. During each run of uorf4u, a tsv table with information about assemblies (from identical protein database, ncbi) for each protein is saved to your output folder (output_dir_name/assemblies_list.tsv). There are cases with multiple assemblies for one protein accession numbers (up to thousands). In case to control assemblies included in the analysis this table can be filtered (simply by removing rows) and then used with this parameter as part of input to the next run.  
In addition, config file (see config parameters section) has max_number_of_assemblies parameter. It can be used to limit max number of assemblies included in the analysis. In case number of assemblies is more than the cutoff, random sampling will be used to take only subset of them.

- `-at` *aa|nt*  
Alignment type used by uorf4u for conserved ORFs searching [default: aa]. 

- `-sao`  
Save information about annotated ORFs as a set of tsv tables (one per each upstream sequence) [default: false].


- `-o` *dirname*  
Output dirname. It will be created if it's not exist. All output dirs will be then created in this folder [default: uorf4u_{current_date}; e.g. uorf4u_2022_07_25-20_41].


- `-c` *file.cfg*  
Path to a configuration file [default: internal].


**MISCELLANEOUS ARGUMENTS**

- `-h`, `--help`  
Show this help message and exit.

- `-v`, `--version`  
Show program version.

- `--debug`  #to be added  
Provide detailed stack trace for debugging purposes.

- `--verbose`  # to be added  
Show all progress messages [default: False]
